💡Abstract:
  The previously published works still suffer from the following limitations: 1) The subjective studies only focused on the ability of night-time image enhancement (NTIE) algorithms in boosting the intensity of low-light regions, 
which neglected analyzing the impact of night-time scenes under different lighting conditions (e.g., extreme-low light and uneven light) on the quality of enhanced night-time images (ENTIs) generated by different NTIE algorithms; 
2) Only traditional image enhancement algorithms were used to generate ENTIs without considering the emerging deep learning-based image enhancement algorithms, which may make the dataset cannot fully reflect the quality degradation 
factors; 3) The performance of the existing IQA metrics for ENTIs were not robust enough for real applications, which called for effective and reliable objective quality evaluation metrics to automatically assess the quality of ENTIs.
We constructed a new RNTIEQA dataset for night-time image enhancement, and carried out human subjective studies to compare the quality of ENTIs obtained by a set of representative night-time image enhancement algorithms.We proposed a 
new objective ranking method that comprehensively considering image intrinsic and impairment attributes for automatically predicting the quality of enhanced night-time images.
